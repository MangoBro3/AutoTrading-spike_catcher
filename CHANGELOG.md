# CHANGELOG

## [2026-02-18] Round 1
- What:
  - Initialized Artifact-Driven Squad workflow files (`SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).
  - Added first contract reference ticket `T-001`.
- Why:
  - Enforce state-over-chat execution and contract-first development.
- Risk:
  - Low. Documentation/control-plane update only.
- Migration/Notes:
  - All implementation must start only after `contracts/T-001.contract.v1.json` approval.
